# quiz-web-app
Client and server for a quiz web app. The general idea is as follows:
<ul>
  <li>New Quizzes are manually uploaded by an administrator (more on that when it's implemented)</li>
  <li>Each user can submit one set of answers per Quiz</li>
  <li>Each Quiz is made up of one or more Rounds</li>
  <li>A leaderboard shows high scores for:
    <ul>
      <li>each Quiz</li>
      <li>running monthly totals</li>
      <li>all-time totals</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
  

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
